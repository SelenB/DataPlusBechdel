DATA WE ARE USING:
We are using data behind FiveThiryEight's article "The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood's Exclusion of Women"
(https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/). This data can
be found at (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bechdel).

We next found data on people in production that was used in The Pudding's article "Hollywood's Gender Divide and Its
Effect on Films" (https://pudding.cool/2017/03/bechdel/).

We also used The Pudding's data on speaking times broken down by gender in movies. We found this data on GitHub, at
(https://github.com/matthewfdaniels/scripts/). This data was originally presented in their article "Film Dialogue from
2,000 screenplays, Broken Down by Gender and Age" (https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/).

We combined these datasets and took out all foreign films we could find to create movieData.txt. To remove foreign films,
we first took out all movies that had 0 domestic gross. We then combed through the list of movies and removed movies whose
titles were not in English or had a very low domestic gross (we checked each of these on IMDB.com to make sure that these
were foreign films).

FILE LIST AND DESCRIPTIONS:

movieData -- our most current file of movie which includes their bechdel score, people in production (writers, directors,
and producers), and speaking time of female characters.

baseObjectOriented.py -- reads in movieData file and creates a list of people objects and a list of movie objects

baseToCSV.py -- takes peopleList and movieList from baseObjectOriented.py and writes file 'allConnections.csv' that includes
any and all connections (shared movies) between people

allConnections.csv -- csv file (in format for Cytoscape use) that includes all connections (defined as the existence of a shared movie)
between people in peopleList. NOTE: this file is huge and has 105732 rows (edges).

baseGraph.py -- uses peopleList from baseObjectOriented.py and methods/functions from baseToCSV.py, creates a graph with
people as nodes and edges as shared movies between people

centralityScores.py -- calculates (degree, closeness, and betweenness) centrality scores for each person and stores in
dictionaries. Given an integer n, finds the n people with top centrality scores for each type. Prints out the list of people with
top n centrality scores. Writes a file in the format of allConnections.csv but that only includes these top centrality people
and all of their external connections as well. Calculates and returns the average Bechdel score for top n group (and top centrality
people list overall).

topCentralityAllConnections.csv -- csv file (in format for Cytoscape use) that has all top n (10 in this case) centrality score people
(in this case 14 people), and all of their connections.

cliques.py -- returns the total number of cliques, the number of cliques n or larger, and the number of 'strong' cliques (cliques with
edges requiring more than 1 collaboration). Writes file of all 'strong' cliques.

seriesCliques.csv -- csv file (in format for Cytoscape use) with all inter-clique connections of cliques of at least 6 people who all
have ties of strength 3+.
